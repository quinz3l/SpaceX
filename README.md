# Data Analysis and Interactive Dashboard

## Description
This project focuses on data analysis and visualization using Python. It covers various stages of data processing, from retrieval and wrangling to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive analytics. Additionally, it includes an interactive dashboard built with Plotly Dash for visualizing SpaceX launch data.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:

1. **Data Retrieval (Data Retrieving.ipynb)**
   - Fetches data from various sources.
   - Prepares raw data for further processing.

2. **Data Wrangling (Data Wrangling.ipynb)**
   - Cleans and transforms the raw data.
   - Handles missing values and outliers.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **EDA with SQL (EDA-SQL.ipynb):** Performs SQL-based analysis.
   - **EDA with Python (EDA_Python.ipynb & EDA with visualization.ipynb):** Uses Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data exploration and visualization.

4. **Interactive Visual Analytics (Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium lab.ipynb)**
   - Uses Folium to create interactive maps for geospatial data visualization.

5. **Predictive Analysis (Predictive Analysis.ipynb)**
   - Implements machine learning models for predictive analytics.

6. **Interactive Dashboard (Build an Interactive Dashboard with Plotly Dash.py)**
   - Develops a web-based dashboard using Plotly Dash.
   - Visualizes SpaceX launch data, including success rates and payload correlations.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Dash, Folium)
- SQL
- Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)

## How to Run
1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly dash folium scikit-learn
   ```
2. Run the dashboard:
   ```bash
   python "Build an Interactive Dashboard with Plotly Dash.py"
   ```
3. Open the browser and navigate to the provided localhost URL.

## Results and Insights
- Conducted data cleaning and transformation for meaningful insights.
- Performed exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends.
- Built an interactive dashboard to visualize launch success rates.
- Implemented predictive models to analyze key factors affecting outcomes.

## Conclusion
This project showcases end-to-end data analysis, from data retrieval to interactive visualization. It demonstrates the integration of SQL, Python, and Dash for a comprehensive data science workflow.
